# Chess
A simple chess game I'm writing to learn object oriented programming.

Currently only works for terminals but I plan to create a gui, simply because it is much easier to play chess without having to write D7 to D8 everytime (at least for casuals like me).

This is what the program can do now and also the extent of it's abilities apart from displaying in letters.
