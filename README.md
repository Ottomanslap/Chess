# Chess
A simple chess game I'm writing to learn object oriented programming.

Currently only works for terminals but I plan to create a gui, simply because it is much easier to play chess without having to write D7 to D8 everytime (at least for casuals like me).

Can your setup handle symbols? (y/n/idk):idk                                                                                   
Can you see two different characters here? ♙♟ (y/n):y

(GitHub's text makes the spaces disappear, its actually aligned)

This is what the program can do now and also the extent of it's abilities apart from displaying in letters.
